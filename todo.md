# TODO List for KAG Gather Bot

## Current TODO:

- Test, test, test!
- Test !report/!ignore stuff

## Future Additions/TODO:

- Figure out a better way to handle AFK rather than polling queue members every 2 minutes; was lagging bot signficantly
    - Consider everytime an !add/!rem is done doing afk polling
- Add !start support for server-specific matches
- Add !report decay so that they expire after X days
